# IMPORTANT
This library is under construction, I pushed a first release candidate version of it but I haven't had time to test it yet, I will do so on the next few days and remove this message. I will also add more documentation on how to use it then.

# Volley Wrapper
This project is a wrapper of the [Volley network library](http://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html) for Android. The reason why I created it is because after using Volley for a couple of projects I realized I ended up implementing the same code over and over to be able to easily send requests and parse responses using Gson, so I decided to abstract all that code to a library that I can use on every project, and hopefully other people can use it too to make the interaction with Volley a bit easier.

# Documentation
All the documentation on how to setup and use this library can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/hipsheep/volley-wrapper/wiki).
